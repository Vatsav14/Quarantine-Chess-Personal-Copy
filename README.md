# Quarantine-Chess-Personal-Copy
A personal copy of the Quarantine Chess game created by the Walking Cow group during lockdown 2020.

This project uses Object Oriented Programming in JAVA to implement the game of chess. The graphical user interface was developed using AWT and Swing which are Java Foundational Classes containing interactive components like buttons, text fields, labels, etc.
